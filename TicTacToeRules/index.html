    <h4>
        Tic-Tac-Toe can be played by one player or two. The first player is player X and the second is player O. To play Tic-Tac-Toe each player takes turns checking a box in the 3 by 3 board. The objective of the game is to block your opponent from getting three in a row while trying to get three in a row yourself. Once you or your opponent get three in a row the game is over and the winner is displayed at the bottom of your screen. If no one gets three in a row, it is declared a tie.
